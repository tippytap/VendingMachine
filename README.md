Simulates a vending machine

## Instructions
The menu is numbered 0 - 5, for each of the six products that are stocked. Extra menu items are displayed depending on the menu you are currently in. 
#### Buying an item
Buy an item by first entering coins. Then you may select a product. If the price matches the total amount you entered, you recieve the product and it is subtracted from the stock.
#### Restocking an item
Once an item has been vended, you may restock it. Each product category may only have 6 items at a time. Go to the maintenance menu, then select "Stock item". After that you will be shown the current stock. Select "Create item" to add an item to the stock. Type in the name of the item, and make sure it matches the name of an existing item. Do the same with price (you will be prompted for these).
#### Getting change back
If you have entered too much money and select an item, you will receive the difference back as change. If you have entered money and change your mind about buying something, you can release all the money you have entered.
#### Getting money out of the machine
Go to the maintenance menu, and select "Collect money". The bank will empty and you will receive the money.


## Password
The default password is "admin". You may update the password to whatever string you want!
#### Updating the password
Go to the maintenance menu, and select "Reset passcode". You may then enter a new passcode.

## Exiting the machine
Once you have drunk your fill of soda, you may exit if you wish. Simply type 'exit' at the prompt.
